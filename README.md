This repository contains all of the keystroke and demographic information for my thesis, which explored keystroke dynamics in dialogue.

Further details are coming soon. For now, I have uploaded all of the basic information to get you started:

* `All_Keystrokes.csv` - Every keystroke in the corpus
* `All_Messages.csv` - Every sent message in the corpus
* `Demographics.csv` - Basic demographic information for all participants
* `Questionnaire_Ratings.csv` - All post-conversation ratings and opinions

Most files are pipe-delimited, since message text often contains commas.
