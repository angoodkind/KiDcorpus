The person seemed ""real"" -- clearly not a bot, and probably not an experimenter pretending to be a subject. The thing that I liked was that we were in the same boat in terms of dealing with the pandemic. On social media, people are all siloed -- if you say you're struggling with the pandemic, some people will be on your side and others will jump down your throat because of political divisions. But this person just seemed the same as me, and it was a relief to think that a totally unknown person could just understand ""what it's like."" If it was an experimenter pretending to be a subject, I'll get over it, because they seemed so sincere that I don't think even an experimenter who's following a protocol ""agree with everything"" could fake it that well. So I had a sense of like ""wow, there are other people out there in the same boat, going through the same crap, and we can talk more easily than we can on social media."""|No.|7

The right side of the screen initially confused me and I forgot which person I was, so I couldn't recall if I was supposed to be learning their interests or vice versa.

I grew up with the theatrical films of the 1950s and '60s, but I also saw many films from the 30s and 40s on television during that period. I formed a love for films very early on, and eventually taught Film Studies for 15 years in a creative arts school to gifted students. I'm not as knowledgeable about recent films as I am about those from the Silent Era through say the '80s and a select few up to the present.|No other comments.|4

They've watched a LOT more than I have (I get that impression) and while I tend to have shows on in the background, I feel like they watch them more intently. But we seem to have very similar interests and I think we both took away some good suggestions.|"Hm, no, I think some pairing between ""interests"" (or the inverse) would be fun for a larger study to generate conflicting recommendations or the like."|5

It was a stilted conversation, though they got more comfortable (I think?) as time went on. I did not get a sense of their personality much at all and they didn't give me much to go with when the time came for me to recommend things to them- leading me to just throw out random genres in hops they stick.|I had fun, but wished my partner was more engaging.

Alex was an active participant, but their responses were too slow and too generic. I expect typing ability is more likely the root cause and not an inattentive experience. From this, I also feel that the 8 minute time limit was too constraining for the nuance required with an effective response. I will take the blame for this because I set the pace in the first 8 minute section and I believe my approach was not appropriate for the allocated time. Overall, I believe Alex did not have the necessary information to provide accurate recommendations and was not asked enough probing questions to receive a personalized recommendation.|It was not clear that the section would be split into two 8 minute sections. The plan I formulated to determine an appropriate recommendation assumed that the total countdown timer would be allocated for the task. Also, Alex brought up the issue of UK recommendations in the final lines. I did not consider whether the partner did not reside within the U.S. It is possible they were not familiar with my references|3
